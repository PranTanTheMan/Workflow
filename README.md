Online collaboration is an increasingly important aspect of school curriculum. To service this need, we built Workflow, an easy-to-use, all in one collaboration tool for teachers and students alike. 

We built this tool using Next.js, Typescript, React, Heroku, PostgreSQL, Figma, and 6 different Twilio features: SMS verification, email verification, online payment processing, video calls, live streams, and group chats.

How it works:
