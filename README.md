Online collaboration is an increasingly important aspect of school curriculum. To service this need, we built Workflow, an easy-to-use, all in one collaboration tool for teachers and students alike. 

We built this tool using Next.js, Typescript, React, Heroku, PostgreSQL, Figma, and 6 different Twilio features: SMS verification, email verification, online payment processing, video calls, live streams, and group chats.

How it works (step by step):

1. User signs up

2. SMS verification and email verification using Twilio

3. Login

4. 3 products to choose from which all use Twilio:

Video chat: can be used by students as study rooms, classroom discussion forums, etc.

Live streaming: teachers can host office hours and study session easily without having to switch platforms

Chat: students can ask questions and learn from one another

5. Mobile payments using Twilio (can be done by the school district or school at any time) -- our business model for this product follows traditional edtech models. We charge schools or school districts a one-time $10 USD fee to use our web app fully. Our demo video features the mobile payment feature.
